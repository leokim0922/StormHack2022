Challenges we ran into
We were able to set up the database, but had issues using an API to connect the MySQL database with the main program on IntelliJ and how it all connects together with Spring Boot.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
It was our first time dealing with web project. Even though we had some issues in realizing all the features we expected, but it was a good opportunity to learn the structure of web projects, and some tools like Spring Boot and MySQL.

What we learned
For many of us, it was the first time working with web application tools like Spring Boot and query languages like SQL, so it was definitely a big jump trying to put everything together. We even had some issues with version control that we had to overcome. Troubleshooting through all of the different errors, and navigating through beginner tutorials to figure out how these different technologies interact has definitely been a very good learning experience.
